# My Neovim config
This is a work in progress but also my current daily editor config. Many thanks to all those who helped get me this far.

The unexhastive list includes...
- [Dreams of Code](https://www.youtube.com/@dreamsofcode) - Thanks for starting this addiction
- [Josean Martinez](https://www.youtube.com/@joseanmartinez) - Thanks for the walkthrough vid that I used as a base to get started here.
- [typecraft](https://www.youtube.com/@typecraft_dev) What a nerd!

This Neovim journey started with...
- [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/) - From Dreams of Code vid.
- Messed around with various neovim packages/IDE's/whatever you call them...
    - [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)
    - [AstroVim](https://astronvim.com/)
    - [kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)
- Started with the vid from Josean and pulled together the things I liked from what I learned above.
- Eventually made it into this monster.
